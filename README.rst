Environment and External Dependencies
========================================
This section describes how to set up your Python environment for the KCWI DRP, and covers a few external dependencies.

We highly recommend that you use Anaconda for this installation. Using a conda environment ensures that the DRPâ€™s requirements will not conflict with other software and packages you have installed on your machine, among other benefits.
